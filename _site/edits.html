<h2 id="solutionsfranchises">Solutions/Franchises</h2>
<p>Franchises
Franchise POS marketing differs significantly from small business or multi-location marketing.</p>
<p>Unlike small businesses, franchises operate under a strict marketing management system. The franchisor sets the overall marketing strategy and brand standards, while franchisees manage individual locations, following specific marketing guidelines to maintain brand consistency.</p>
<p>Multi-location marketing involves coordinating efforts across several locations. In contrast, franchise in-store and POS marketing focuses on empowering individual franchisees to market their locations effectively while aligning with the overall brand strategy.</p>
<p>ClearLine, a leading provider of digital in-store and POS marketing solutions, understands the unique needs of franchise businesses. We offer a range of innovative products and features to assist franchisees in their marketing efforts. With user-friendly software and reliable hardware, ClearLine equips franchisees with the tools needed to streamline marketing efforts and drive customer engagement.</p>
<h3 id="why-clearline-marketing">Why ClearLine Marketing?</h3>
<p>📌 <strong>Note:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a few “why clearline” statements on the site already. Should we use only one vs recreating for each page?*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ClearLine makes it easy to create and distribute digital in-store and POS marketing materials. This helps maintain brand consistency across all units by digitizing traditional in-store marketing.</p>
<p>With ClearLine, you gain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized control</li>
<li>Easy and intuitive digitized in-store marketing</li>
<li>Seamless distribution</li>
<li>Effective data capture</li>
<li>POS integration</li>
<li>Compatibility with existing franchise systems and services</li>

<p>With ClearLine’s innovative software, businesses can effortlessly engage customers, increase spending, generate positive reviews, and promote brand loyalty—all at the point of sale.</p>

<h3 id="why-clearline-2">Why ClearLine?</h3>
<p>ClearLine’s marketing software works seamlessly with any POS system provider on the market.</p>

<h3 id="use-cases-3">Use Cases</h3>

<h3 id="online-reputation">Online Reputation</h3>
<p>With ClearLine’s software, businesses can prompt customers who spend above a certain amount to leave a review by scanning a QR code on the Customer Facing Display.</p>

<h3 id="effortless-in-store-marketing">Effortless In-Store Marketing</h3>
<p>When implemented correctly, in-store and POS marketing can be a substitute for expensive online marketing.</p>

This trend has continued, with 75.8 million U.S. smartphone users scanning a QR code last year, a 15.3% increase from 2020. By 2025, it's predicted that 99.5 million people in the U.S. will use QR codes.</p>

<p>No, there are no additional costs or licensing fees for using the Elements you've downloaded.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-auto-renew">What is Auto-Renew?</h3>
<p>Auto-Renew means your subscription automatically renews each month on the same day it started, as long as your billing information is valid and you haven't canceled. If you don't want to renew, you can cancel anytime through your account dashboard before the end of your billing period.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-usercustomer-interaction">What is User/Customer Interaction?</h3>
<p>A user or customer interaction occurs when:</p>
<ul>
<li>A review request is sent via SMS, email, or QR code scan.</li>
<li>A customer clicks a link to open a landing page with your review links and follows through to leave a review on Google, Yelp, or Facebook.</li>

<h3 id="how-are-user-interactions-measured">How are User Interactions Measured?</h3>

<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-an-account-and-a-location">What is the difference between an Account and a Location?</h3>
<p>An account represents your business entity in our system and includes users and one or more locations. A location is the physical business address you operate from or promote using our marketing software. Each message sent by our platform includes your location details. One account can have multiple locations, each requiring a paid monthly plan, and all locations under one account must be on the same plan.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-reach-my-limit-of-user-interactions-before-the-end-of-the-billing-cycle">What if I reach my limit of user interactions before the end of the billing cycle?**</h3>
<p>We won't interrupt your marketing campaigns or deactivate coupons and loyalty cards if you reach your limit of user interactions.</p>
<p>If your usage overage is 10% or less, we allow free overdraft use. If it’s more than 10% or happens before the 20th day of the billing cycle, we may upgrade you to the next package to provide more user interactions.</p>
