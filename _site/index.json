ClearLine supports both strategies seamlessly. Our platform and hardware can be tailored to your needs. With the ClearLine Marketing Center, the Customer Facing Screen, the Digital Kiosk, and the Advertising Display, you can display relevant information for each location individually or for all locations simultaneously. Specially Designed Retail Hardware If your strategy is set and you just need POS marketing hardware screens, ClearLine has you covered. We offer a wide range of in-store digital marketing and POS marketing tools for customer interaction and data capture. All of our devices are reliable, ready to use, and specifically designed with in-store businesses in mind. In-Store Marketing The Digital Kiosk and Advertising Display can effortlessly enhance your in-store marketing.

Seems like profiles are more of a back-end feature? Avoid the pitfalls of inexperienced employees having unrestricted access to all features and materials, leading to potential mishaps like accidentally deleting multiple years of customer data. ClearLine offers various access options‚Äîfull or limited, across all locations or just one. White Label If your company prefers developing its own products rather than relying on third-party platforms, ClearLine can be used as a white label solution to maintain consistency with your brand‚Äôs approach. ClearLine will appear as your very own, well-set-up, and branded digital in-store and POS marketing solution. Reporting With ClearLine, reporting is as adaptable as the rest of its features and solutions. ClearLine‚Äôs flexible integration allows you to choose how you manage your reporting. Use the ClearLine platform or send the data to your preferred collection point. Store POS and in-store marketing information separately or combine it with your other data‚Äîit's your choice. Solutions/Franchises Franchises Franchise POS marketing differs significantly from small business or multi-location marketing. Unlike small businesses, franchises operate under a strict marketing management system. The franchisor sets the overall marketing strategy and brand standards, while franchisees manage individual locations, following specific marketing guidelines to maintain brand consistency. Multi-location marketing involves coordinating efforts across several locations. In contrast, franchise in-store and POS marketing focuses on empowering individual franchisees to market their locations effectively while aligning with the overall brand strategy. ClearLine, a leading provider of digital in-store and POS marketing solutions, understands the unique needs of franchise businesses. We offer a range of innovative products and features to assist franchisees in their marketing efforts. With user-friendly software and reliable hardware, ClearLine equips franchisees with the tools needed to streamline marketing efforts and drive customer engagement. Why ClearLine Marketing? üìå Note: There are a few ‚Äúwhy clearline‚Äù statements on the site already. Should we use only one vs recreating for each page?* ClearLine makes it easy to create and distribute digital in-store and POS marketing materials. This helps maintain brand consistency across all units by digitizing traditional in-store marketing. With ClearLine, you gain: Centralized control Easy and intuitive digitized in-store marketing Seamless distribution Effective data capture POS integration Compatibility with existing franchise systems and services Use Cases: Franchise Marketing Explore the practical aspects of implementing ClearLine for franchise marketing. Templates ClearLine‚Äôs Templates Library provides franchisees with access to pre-designed templates for marketing materials, ensuring consistent and professional marketing offerings across all franchise locations. The Templates Library also optimizes QR code marketing and short URL content distribution, enhancing customer engagement. Ease of Distribution Distributing your marketing materials across all units has never been easier. You have the control to decide whether access to your materials will be granted to all units or restricted to a specific group. This flexibility can serve as an additional perk to encourage greater B2B involvement. Control Over Access üìå Note: Is this the same as above, necessary? Should they be collapsed into one? With ClearLine, you have full control to manage access to your marketing materials. If needed, you can revoke a unit‚Äôs access to previously shared materials entirely or selectively. You can also restrict access to any future materials, ensuring your marketing strategy remains aligned with your business needs. Track the Efficiency ClearLine captures data on customer interactions, allowing you to assess the performance of each piece of marketing material. Utilize this data to determine if a new activity is more popular in certain areas or if a specific marketing idea has proven successful on a small scale and is ready for franchise-wide implementation. White Label üìå Note: Can we reuse or consolidate the ‚Äòwhite label‚Äù verbiage that is here? If you prefer to keep your affiliation with ClearLine confidential, you can brand it as your product or even offer it as a franchise perk. There is no need to disclose your partnership with ClearLine, whether to reduce competition or to maintain the image of your franchise as a highly innovative organization. In-Store Marketing Using ClearLine products alongside our hardware offering provides customers with the benefits of both POS marketing and in-store marketing simultaneously. All it takes is the right setup of a Customer Facing Screen, a Digital Kiosk, and an Advertising Display. Solutions/Marketing Companies Marketing Companies Marketing companies are essential for promoting products and services. ClearLine‚Äôs Marketing Platform creates an instant connection between businesses and customers at the point of sale, removing delays and boosting efficiency for immediate, measurable results. With ClearLine, businesses can: Implement digital marketing at the point of sale, pick-up, or delivery Increase customer spending Collect reviews and feedback Capture customer data Digitize loyalty program enrollment And much more. Why ClearLine? üìå Note: There are quite a few ‚Äúwhy clearline‚Äù statements on the site. Should we use only one vs recreating for each page? (see extracts in why doc) ClearLine integrates digital marketing with traditional POS marketing, adding innovative engagement features to create a comprehensive marketing solution. Traditional POS marketing focuses on visually appealing elements and strategic placement to effectively target audiences. ClearLine enhances this approach by increasing participation and accountability, providing concrete data to demonstrate the effectiveness of POS marketing. Beyond boosting sales and brand awareness, ClearLine tools transform a single POS campaign into opportunities for growing your social media following and improving your online reputation. Use Cases üìå Note: These seem to be reused as well. Should we consolidate and use one? Data Analytics Enhancement üìå Note: This is duplicated (2 in a row) on the website. POS marketing provides valuable data on customer behavior and preferences, which can be used to optimize marketing strategies and improve business operations. ClearLine keeps track of client activity, enabling businesses or their representatives to identify trends and make data-driven decisions that lead to increased sales and customer satisfaction. Visual Material Usage ClearLine‚Äôs Template Library empowers agencies to create eye-catching displays and signage that effectively promote their clients' products or services. The library offers a variety of customizable templates with consistent tracking. Marketing agencies can use these tools to help their clients develop attractive and informative displays that align with their brand and marketing goals. Customer Data Storage ClearLine caters to clients with or without their own data storage systems. For clients without data storage capabilities, ClearLine securely stores the collected data, ensuring they still benefit from comprehensive customer analytics. This means your clients can enjoy all the advantages of detailed customer insights without the need for their own storage infrastructure. Versatility ClearLine allows synchronization with third-party systems and platforms, enabling businesses to retain and integrate existing, effective solutions. This flexibility ensures that clients can benefit from everything the market currently offers without discarding what already works. White Label üìå Note: Do we need this? Or should we just define white label more generically? ClearLine apps and services can enhance your competitive advantage. You don‚Äôt need to disclose your affiliation with ClearLine to your clients. Instead, use ClearLine as a white-label solution, branding it according to your needs to create an incredible offer for your clients.

Why ClearLine? ClearLine‚Äôs marketing software works seamlessly with any POS system provider on the market.

While a payment is being processed, customers can engage with the marketing activities you‚Äôve set up at your point of sale. Use Cases Let‚Äôs explore how ClearLine works in practice across various common business scenarios. Online Reputation With ClearLine‚Äôs software, businesses can prompt customers who spend above a certain amount to leave a review by scanning a QR code on the Customer Facing Display.

POS Coupon Marketing Businesses can boost customer retention and drive repeat purchases by automating coupon offers with ClearLine‚Äôs software.

Smart QR Codes QR (quick response) codes have been around since 1994, originally developed by a Japanese engineer for tracking components in car factories. Over the years, they have evolved into a powerful marketing tool. During the Covid-19 pandemic, QR codes saw a resurgence in popularity, particularly in restaurants for contactless menus. This trend has continued, with 75.8 million U.S. smartphone users scanning a QR code last year, a 15.3% increase from 2020. By 2025, it's predicted that 99.5 million people in the U.S. will use QR codes. The Power of QR Codes Why Use QR Codes in Your Marketing? QR codes simplify the consumer journey by taking customers directly to the desired online destination, such as: Websites: Direct customers to your main website. Landing Pages: Promote giveaways, special offers, or promotions. Downloads: Offer free downloads to increase engagement and build a loyal audience. Tutorials and Videos: Provide how-to videos or exclusive event-only content. Using QR codes in your marketing strategy can streamline the customer experience and enhance engagement, making them a valuable tool for modern businesses. Measure Campaign Effectiveness: QR codes help you easily track the success of campaigns and ads, like those in magazines. Collect First-Party Data: Gather valuable data directly from customers, crucial as companies like Google move away from third-party data. Customization: Modern QR codes can include your brand colors and logo. However, avoid excessive customization to ensure they remain easy to scan, especially for older phones. Simple and Effective Advertising: QR codes have become essential in technology and marketing, offering a straightforward way to engage customers and enhance business operations. Proven Success: Since 2011, we've helped hundreds of brands and small businesses leverage QR codes for effective marketing. *Data from Forbes Marketing with QR Code Rebecca Kowalewicz, Vice President, Digital at Clearbridge Branding Agency Why QR Code Marketing? üìå Note: Is this page a dup?
